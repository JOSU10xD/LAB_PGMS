# 15. Develop a Python program to implement the following scenario. A bookshopâ€™s details
#     contain the title of the book and Number of copies of each title. As books are added
#     to shop the number of copies in each should increase and as books are sold the number
#     of copies in each should decrease.

# Algorithm
# 1. Start
# 2. Initialize an empty list called "bookshop" to store book titles and copies.
# 3. Display a menu with options: "Add Book," "Sell Book," "Display all books," "Quit."
# 4. Accept the user's choice.
# 5. If the choice is "Add Book":
#    5.1. Prompt for a book title and the number of copies to add.
#    5.2. If the book exists in the "bookshop," update the copy count; otherwise, add the book.
# 6. If the choice is "Sell Book":
#    6.1. Prompt for a book title and the number of copies to sell.
#    6.2. If the book exists and has enough copies, update the stock; remove it if sold out.
#    6.3. If the book doesn't exist, print a "book not found" message.
#    6.4. If there are not enough copies, print an "out of stock" message.
# 7. If the choice is "Display all books," show the list of available books.
# 8. If the choice is "Quit," end the program.
# 9. If the choice is invalid, display an "Invalid choice" message.
# 10. Repeat from step 3 until the user chooses to quit.
# 11. Stop
